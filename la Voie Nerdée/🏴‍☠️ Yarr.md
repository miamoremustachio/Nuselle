Piracy usually means downloading or distributing copyright-restricted content, like music, programs, games & all other sorts of media - so, I think that's exactly what you're looking for.

In some countries it's illegal, in some others they don't give a hoot - but eventually it all comes down to your personal moral standards.

Since you already asked for free movies, I'm sure our standarts are pretty similar😂

[[yt-dlp]] itself has nothing to do with piracy _(some say downloading music from YouTube is PiRaCY, but I personally consider it as pure bullshit)._

So, yeah, there are some places to watch stuff, sort of online-cinemas - but they are usually not great for downloading things.

But torrenting is truly the way 🏴‍☠️

For this you need:

- a good ship - aka torrent client, which is basically a program that establish a peer-to-peer connection needed for downloading/uploading _(qBittorrent is best of all, trust me)_
- a harbor - place where you can get .torrent files. It's just an extension, like .exe or .txt, which all torrent clients can read - the desired movie itself eventually comes later, after you connect to people who seed (upload) it at the moment.
- a chest - get a good big SSD or HDD if you don't have one - you will need space for things, cause movies and ESPECIALLY tv-series usually quite large.
- and a pirate code of honor - always remember to seed what you got! Don't be a jerk pls, no one loves those guys who just download things and run away without sharing the treasure with others.

Also, take a look at r/Piracy and r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH - both subs has the greatest wiki pages which helped me a ton. I'm not a salty sea captain either, just know the basics.

And there you can learn what is seeding, peering, how to set up a VPN if you need - it seems complicated and tedious at first, but once you get used to it, you'll never go back to shady online theatres.

Hope it helps, and enjoy the freedom🩵
