A *daemon* is a program that runs as a background process and performs certain tasks without direct user interaction.

Daemons are essential for the smooth operation of a Linux system, providing core services and managing resources.
They are typically launched automatically during system boot by the `init` system (like [[systemd]] or SysVinit), ensuring that essential services are available from the start.
