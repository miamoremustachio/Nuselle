[Node JS](https://www.educative.io/answers/introduction-to-node-js) is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment with an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

“Non-blocking” means that the execution of the program continues without waiting for the I/O operation to finish.

When the operation is completed, a callback is triggered to handle the result.
