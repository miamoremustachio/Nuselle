## ✍️ Declaration

```jsx
let arr = [];
let arr = new Array();
let arr = Array.of();
```

## 📤 Getting elements

To get the last element of the array, instead of calculating the last element index we can use `.at()` method:

```jsx
const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

console.log( fruits.at(-1) ); // Plum
// same as fruits[fruits.length - 1]
```

## 🃏 Queue VS Stack

A _queue_ is an ordered collection of elements which supports two operations:

- `push` appends an element to the end.
- `shift` get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st.

*First in first out (FIFO)*

A _stack_ also supports two operations:

- `push` adds an element to the end.
- `pop` takes an element from the end.

A stack is usually illustrated as a pack of cards: new cards are added to the top or taken from the top:

*Last in first out (LIFO)*

Arrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. They allow you to add/remove elements, both to/from the beginning or the end.

> It’s much faster to work with the end of the array then the beginning 🏁
