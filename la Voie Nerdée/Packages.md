A *package* is a compressed archive containing all the files needed to install a specific software, along with metadata describing its purpose, version, and list of dependencies.
Packages are stored in *repositories*, which are servers that host collections of packages.

A tool that handle the process of installing, updating and removing packages calls *package manager*.
