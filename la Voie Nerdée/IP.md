The [Internet Protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/), known as **IP,** makes it possible for devices to communicate over the [Internet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/how-does-the-internet-work/) by assigning IP numbers to every device accessing the web.

When a user types a [domain name](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/), like [google.com](http://google.com), into a web browser, this will initiate a request to Google’s web server asking for content (the Google homepage).

Using the provided IP address, Google can send a response back to the user’s device, which will then display that content in the user’s browser.

The system that orchestrates all this is called [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/). It works like a phone book for IP addresses so that users can access web services using human-friendly domain names.
