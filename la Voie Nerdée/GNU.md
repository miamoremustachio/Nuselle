*The GNU Project* is an open-source programming project started by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) in 1983.

Its goal is to give users freedom and control in use of their computers by giving everyone the rights to freely run, modify and distribute the software.
GNU software grants these rights in [[GNU GPL|its license]].

Most of the programs used in [[Operating systems#*LINUX*|Linux]] environment are written within the GNU project.
It includes a comprehensive set of free software tools for Unix-like operating systems, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), [[bash]], [[grub|GRUB]], [[Emacs]] and many others.

The largest contributor of GNU Project is the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/), which created not only most of the tools used in GNU/Linux, but also the philosophy and the community around it.
