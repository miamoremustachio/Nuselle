A *file* is a a named set of data stored on a storage device.

Files are controlled by a [[file system]], which provides a structured way to store, organize and manage them.

In Unix-like operating systems, *everything is a file*, which means that the OS treats all resources, such as hardware [[devices]], [[processes]], and network connections, as files that can be interacted with using the same standard I/O operations like `open`, `read`, `write` etc.
